    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Béarnaise Sauce, considered by many to be one of the finest steak sauces
         in the world, and a classic spin on Hollandaise sauce, one of the 5 French
          “mother sauces.” It’s notoriously difficult to make by hand. 
          This recipe uses a foolproof stick blender method that yields exactly
           the same results in 2 minutes flat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Infused Vinegar</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp white wine , dry, not too fruity, sweet or woody (Note 1)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 eschallot</li>
        <li>2 sprigs tarragon</li>
    </ul>    
    <h4>Béarnaise Sauce</h4> 
    <ul>
        <li>3 egg yolks, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt, kosher/cooking salt</li>
        <li>225g / 16 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1cm / 1&quot; cubes – 2 US sticks</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp tarragon leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp chervil, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>   
    
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <h4>Infused Vinegar:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Place Infused Vinegar ingredients in a small saucepan over medium low heat.</li>
  <li>Simmer for 2 minutes, then remove from stove and let it stand for 5 minutes to infuse.</li>
  <li>Strain, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible. You should have around 1 tbsp of liquid. Cool 5 minutes before use.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Quick Clarified Butter:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Place butter in a jug and microwave until melted (1 – 1½ minutes on high, but watch it carefully so it doesn't explode!).</li>
  <li>Stand for 30 seconds until the milky whites settle at the bottom (this is the milk solids) and clarified butter (golden part) sits above it.</li>
  <li>Pour off 175g / 3/4 cup of the clarified butter, discard the milky whites remaining. Use in this recipe while hot.</li>
  <li>Alternative: Just melt 175g / 3/4 cup ghee, which is the same thing as clarified butter.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Béarnaise Sauce:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Place egg yolks, infused vinegar and salt in a tall, narrow container that the blender stick fits in all the way to the base. Blitz briefly to combine.</li>
  <li>With the stick blender going on high, slowly drizzle the butter in over about a minute. Important: The butter must still be hot! If it has cooled, reheat until hot.</li>
  <li>After all the butter is in, blitz for a further 10 seconds, moving the stick up and down.</li>
  <li>Thickness: Add 1 tablespoon water, then blitz to incorporate. Add more water as needed, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the Bearnaise Sauce is a thick sauce but loose enough to ooze across a steak, coating it thickly.</li>
  <li>Fresh herbs: Stir in tarragon and chervil.</li>
  <li>Using: Use immediately, or keep warm until required. I use a thermos – a good one will keep it warm for at least 1 hour. Use warm or at room temperature. See note for storing and reheating.</li>
