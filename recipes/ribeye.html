    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bone-in rib eye steaks are simply basted with butter, garlic, 
        rosemary, and thyme and cooked in a cast-iron skillet, 
        infusing them with full-bodied flavor.
    </p>    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 1/4-pound) bone-in rib eye steaks</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 rosemary sprig</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Season the rib eye steaks all over with salt and freshly ground pepper. Let the meat stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large cast-iron skillet, heat until shimmering. Add the steaks and cook over high heat until crusty on the bottom, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the steaks and add the butter, thyme, garlic, and rosemary to the skillet. Cook over high heat, basting the steaks with the melted butter, garlic, and herbs, until the steaks are medium-rare, 5 to 7 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut the steaks off the bone, then slice the meat across the grain and serve.</li>
    </ol>
