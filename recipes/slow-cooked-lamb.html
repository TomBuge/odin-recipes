    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A decent shoulder of lamb is amazing however you cook it 
        - this way's simple and does the meat proud</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 big bunch of fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 bulb of garlic</li>
        <li>2kg shoulder of lamb or hogget</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>500g seasonal greens, such as 
            white cabbage, Savoy cabbage, Brussels tops, cavolo nero</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to full whack.</li>
        <li>Lay half the rosemary into the bottom 
            of a high-sided roasting tray. Break up the garlic bulb, then scatter in half of the unpeeled cloves.</li>
        <li>Slash the fat side of the lamb all over with a sharp knife, then rub with oil, sea salt and black 
            pepper. Place into the tray, then scatter the remaining rosemary and garlic on top.</li>    
        <li>Tightly cover the tray with tin foil and place in the oven. Immediately turn the temperature down to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 
            and cook for around 4 hours – it’s done if you can pull the meat apart easily with two forks.</li>        
    </ol>
